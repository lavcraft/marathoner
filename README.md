# Marathoner

Marathoner is a service discovery for marathon. It publishes
service ports from marathon on desired interface so you always
talk to `127.0.0.1` and known port. It manages haproxy and
ensures that configuration is updated as soon as there are
changes in running marathon tasks.

Marathoner consists of two parts:

* Listeners listen for updates and handles config update and haproxy reload.
* Updaters keep track of running and healthy apps and pushes changes to listeners.

You would probably want to run 3-5 updaters (one per marathon server)
and listeners on each node for high availability.

You can also run optional logger to log every state change that happens.

## Features

* Nearly zero configuration, everything needed is in marathon.
* Both components are independent and share nothing for high availability.
* Marathon api is only used by updaters, thus reducing load on marathon.
* Health check awareness, only healthy tasks are added to haproxy.
* Nothing breaks if marathon goes down for some reason.
* Listeners do nothing if no changes happen in marathon, no polling involved.
* Graceful restarts and config checking for haproxy to avoid downtime.
* Services available externally and internally without any app code changes.

## Usage

Marathoner is designed to run in docker containers.

### Updater

The following command runs marathoner updater with
update interval of 1 second and two marathon hosts.
Updater is reachable at port 7676.

```
docker run -d -p 7676:7676 lavcraft/marathoner-updater:1.10 \
  -m http://marathon1:8080,http://marathon2:8080 -i 1
```

### Listener

The following command runs marathoner listener with
two updaters and publishes apps on `127.0.0.1`.
Notice that you need to run listener with `--net=host`.

```
docker run -d --net=host lavcraft/marathoner-listener:1.10 \
  -u marathoner-updater1:7676,marathoner-updater2:7676 -b 127.0.0.1
```

### Logger

The following command runs marathoner logger with
specified updater and logs state changes to stdout:

```
docker run --rm lavcraft/marathoner-logger:1.10 -u marathoner-updater1:7676
```

### Exposing apps

Marathon apps that needs to be exported should have label
`marathoner_haproxy_enabled` set to `true`.

## Building

If you made some changes and wish to check how they work, `./containers/make.sh`
could help you with building containers. Just run:

```sh
# build listener image with the name my-listener
./containers/make.sh listener my-listener

# build updater image with the name my-updater
./containers/make.sh updater my-updater

# build logger image with the name my-logger
./containers/make.sh updater my-logger
```

## TODO

* tagged automated builds with godep maybe
